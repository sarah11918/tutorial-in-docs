## BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:

## Summary

**Markdown** is a language that is popular for writing longer-form text like articles and blog posts. It includes shorthand symbols for common HTML elements such as headers, font styling, lists and even more complicated items like tables that several applications can render as HTML. Writing content with Markdown allows you to focus on your text, while providing some basic formatting options without the need to wrap words in standard HTML tags.

In Astro, you can add Markdown files (`.md`) anywhere within `src/pages` in your project to automatically create pages for your website.
