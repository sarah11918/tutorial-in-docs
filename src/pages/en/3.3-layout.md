## BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:
- extracted common page elements into a layout component
- used an Astro `<slot />` element to send page contents to the layout
- passed page data as props to its layout using a component attribute


Now that you have some Astro components repeatedly rendered on every page, let's refactor again to create a single page layout!

## Create an Astro Layout 

1. Create a new file at the location `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`. (You may need to create a new `layouts` folder first.)
2. Copy the **entire contents** of `index.astro` into your new file, `BaseLayout.astro`.
```astro
---
import Navigation from '../components/Navigation.astro';
import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
import '../styles/global.css';
const title = "Home Page"
---
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Astro</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <Navigation />
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <Footer />
    </body>
</html>
```

3. Notice that **all** of those HTML elements are things we want to appear on every page, so we can remove most of the content from `index.astro` and still show the same page to the reader via only the `<Layout />` component. Replace the code at `src/pages/index.astro` with the following:
```astro
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro'
---
<BaseLayout></BaseLayout>
```
3. Check your browser preview and verify that your index page looks the same as it did before.

### Using a <slot />

1. Add the following subtitle to your page at `src/pages/index.astro`.

 ```diff
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro'
---
<BaseLayout>
+<h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
</BaseLayout>
```

Check the browser preview again to notice what did (or, spoiler alert: did _not_!) change.
    
2. Add a `<slot />` element to `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` just above the footer component, then check the browser preview of your Home page and notice what really _did_ change this time!

### Pass page-specific props

1. Pass the page title to your layout component from `index.astro` using a component attribute: 
```diff
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro'
---
+<BaseLayout title="Home Page">
    <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
   <p>This site was built with Astro! :rocket </p>
   <img src=https://unsplash.com/image.jpg />
</BaseLayout>
```
 2. Change the script of your `BaseLayout.astro` layout component to receive a page title via `Astro.props` instead of defining it as a constant.
 ```diff
---
import Navigation from '../components/Navigation.astro';
import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
import '../styles/global.css';
- const title = "Home Page"
+ const { title } = Astro.props
---
```
 3. Check your browser preview to verify that your page title has not changed. It has the same value, but is now being rendered dynamically, and each individual page can specify its own title to the layout.
