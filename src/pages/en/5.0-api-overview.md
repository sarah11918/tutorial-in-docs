## Goals

BY THE END OF THIS SECTION, YOU WILL HAVE:

- used `Astro.glob()` to fetch data about all your Markdown files at once and create a blog post archive

- generated multiple pages with a single Astro component with dynamic route paramaters using    `getStaticPaths()`

- created an RSS feed for your blog at `rss.xml`

Now that you have some blog posts, let's use Astro's API to add some typical blog features!
