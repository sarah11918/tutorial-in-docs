## BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:
- created two new blog pages for your site
- created nested layouts to render your layout for Markdown posts inside your main page layout
- incorporated code snippets into your blog posts


Now that you have your first `.md.` blog post written, let's make it look like the rest of the pages on your website!

## Nesting Layouts

You already have a `BaseLayout.astro` for defining the overall layout of your pages. `MarkdownPostLayout.astro` gives you some additional templating, but your blog post doesn't look like a page on your site that. We can fix that with **nested layouts**.


1. Import and render your `BaseLayout` in `src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro`:
```diff
---
+ import BaseLayout from './BaseLayout.astro';
const { content } = Astro.props;
---
+ <BaseLayout>
    <p><em>{content.description}</em></p>
    <p>{content.pubDate.slice(0,10)}</p>
    <h1>{content.title}</h1>
    <p>Written by: {content.author}</p>
    <img src={content.postImage} width="300" />
    <slot />
    <p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
+ </BaseLayout>
```

2. Check your browser preview at `localhost:3000/posts/post-1`. Now you should see content rendered by:

    - Your main page layout, including your styles, navigation links and social footer.
    - Your blog post layout, including frontmatter properties like the description, date, title and image
    - You individual blog post content, including just the text written for that one post
    
3. Now that we have navigation links on our page, we no longer need the link back to our home page provided by our blog post layout. Remove this line from `MarkdownPostLayout.astro`:

```diff
    <slot />
-   <p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
</BaseLayout>
```

3. Check your browser preview again at `localhost:3000/posts/post-1` and verify that this link is no longer displayed. 

## Linking to your post

In order to see our blog post, we have been navigating directly to the URL by typing `localhost:3000/posts/post-1`, which isn't very convenient.

Let's add links to our blog posts (including new ones we will create) on our Blog page.

1. Add the following links inside the component template `src/pages/blog.astro`
```diff
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro'
title = "My Astro Learning Blog"
---
<BaseLayout title={title}>
    <p>This is where I will post about my journey learning Astro.</p>
+    <ul>
+        <li><a href="/posts/post-1">Post 1</a></li>
+        <li><a href="/posts/post-2">Post 2</a></li>
+        <li><a href="/posts/post-3">Post 3</a></li>
+    </ul>
</BaseLayout>
```
2. Now, add two more files in `src/posts/`: `post-2.md` and `post-3.md`. Here is some sample code you can copy and paste into your files, or, you can create your own!
```

layout: ../../layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro
title: My Second Blog Post
author: Astro Learner
description: "After learning some Astro, I couldn't stop!"
postImage: "https://astro.build/assets/blog/astro-showcase/astro-showcase-screenshot.jpg"
pubDate: 2022-07-08

After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!
```
```
---
layout: ../../layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro
title: My Third Blog Post
author: Astro Learner
description: "I had some challenges, but asking in the community really helped!"
postImage: "https://astro.build/assets/blog/community-day/cover.jpg"
pubDate: 2022-07-15

It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!
```

3. Check your browser preview and make sure:
- All your links for Post 1, Post 2 and Post 3 lead to a working page on your site. (If you find a mistake, check your links on `blog.astro` or your Markdown file names!)
- Each blog post shows the same template, and no content is missing. (If one of your blog posts is missing content, check its frontmatter properties!)

## Passing the `title` prop to `BaseLayout.astro`
You might have noticed that when you preview any of your `.astro` pages (Home, About, Blog), your browser tab displays the page title. (See)





## Pass frontmatter properties to a layout

Your frontmatter values can be used not only within your Markdown, but are also available to an Astro layout specified with the special `layout` frontmatter property.
1. Create a new file at `src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro`
2. Copy the following code into `MarkdownPostLayout.astro`

```astro
---
const { content } = Astro.props
---
<p>{content.pubDate.slice(0,10)}</p>
<slot />
<p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
```
2. Add the following frontmatter property in `post-1.md`
```diff
---
+ layout: ../../layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro
title: 'My First Blog Post'
pubDate: 2022-07-01
description: 'This is the first post of my new Astro blog.'
author: 'Astro Learner'
postImage: 'https://astro.build/assets/blog/astro-1-release-update/cover.jpeg' 
---
```

3. Check your browser preview again at `localhost:3000/posts/post-1` (or by adding `/posts/post-1` to the end of the current preview URL in your browser). You should notice two differences to your page, added by your layout:
- The date at the very top of your page
- A link to go back to your home page at the very bottom of your page 

Now, we can choose which content is written in Markdown and injected into our new layout's default slot, and which content we want to instead send to and render using our Astro layout component!

## Try it yourself - refactoring to create a common layout

Identify items common to every blog post, and use `MarkdownPostLayout` to render them, instead of writing them in your Markdown in `post-1.md` and in every future blog post.

Here's an example of refactoring our code to include the `title` in the layout component instead of writing it in the body of our Markdown:

```diff
- # {frontmatter.title}
Written by: {frontmatter.author}
```

```diff
---
const { content } = Astro.props
---
<p>{content.pubDate.slice(0,10)}</p>
+ <h1>{content.title}</h1>
<slot />
<p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
```

Refactor as much as you think is useful to you, remembering that everything that you add to your layout is one less thing you will write in each blog post!

Here is an example of a refactored layout that leaves only individual blog post content rendered by the slot. Feel free to use this, or create your own! 

```astro
---
const { content } = Astro.props
---
<p><em>{content.description}</em></p>
<p>{content.pubDate.slice(0,10)}</p>
<h1>{content.title}</h1>
<p>Written by: {content.author}</p>
<img src={content.postImage} width="300" />
<slot />
<p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
```
Remember: anything rendered by your layout does **not** need to be typed into your blog post! If you notice any duplication when you check your browser preview, then be sure to remove content from your Markdown file.

## Test your knowledge:
Fill in the blanks so that the following is working Astro code:

1. `src/pages/posts/learning-astro.md`
```markdown
---
layout: ../../__________/MyMarkdownLayout.astro
title: "Learning About Markdown in Astro"
_____ : "My first attempt using Markdown in Astro"
---
# {_______.title}

{frontmatter.description}

I learned so much today! Astro allows me to write in Markdown, but also use variables from the frontmatter. I can even even access those values in an Astro layout component.
```
2.  `src/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro`
```astro
---
import ____________ from '../components/Footer.astro'
const { ___________ } = Astro.props
---
<h1>{content.title}</h1>
<p>Written by:{content.______ }</p>
< _______ />
<Footer />
```

## Checklist for moving on:
[ ] I can add meta data to a blog post by creating a property in its YAML frontmatter.
[ ] I have created a layout for Markdown posts that renders the file's Markdown content in a `<slot />.
[ ] I can use values from a blog post's frontmatter both in the Markdown content itself and in that Markdown post's layout component.
[ ] I have created a basic blog template to render common elements and avoid typing them into each individual blog post.
