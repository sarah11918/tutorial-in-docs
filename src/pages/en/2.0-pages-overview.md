## BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:
- created new Astro pages (About, Blog) for your site that are full HTML documents
- added content to an Astro page using HTML elements
- defined variables in Astro frontmatter and used them in the component template
- added scoped styling to an Astro page using Astro's `<style>` tags


Now that you have a working site on the web, let's add pages and content to make it your own!

## Summary
In this section, you will add new pages and content to your Astro website using your code editor in your workspace, either locally on your computer, or in your online cloud workspace.

Before writing any code, you will open your code editor and use its terminal to run Astro in **dev (development) mode** so that can preview your changes while you work. Using the **continuous integration/deployment** system we set up with GitHub and Netlify, any updates you **commit and push** (save) to your project's online repository at GitHub will be automatically discovered by Netlify and re-published to the web.

You will learn about the **two sections of a `.astro` file** and how they work together to create the content for a **single page** on your website. Want to make a new page? You'll add a new `.astro` file to your project!
| `.astro` Section | Language used | contents |
|---|---|---|
| Script (frontmatter) | JavaScript/TypeScript | imports, variables, functions...
| Template (body) | Astro (HTML with additional JSX-like features) | HTML elements, components

_______ I will create a new `.astro` file using my code editor.
_______ I open my project in my code editor and run Astro in dev mode to see a live preview of my changes.
_______ I will commit and push my changes to my repository stored on GitHub.
