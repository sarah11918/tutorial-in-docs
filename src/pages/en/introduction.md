Astro beginner tutorial

BACKGROUND CONTEXT:
(Based on diataxis.fr)

“A tutorial turns new learners into users.”

Tutorials are specifically targeted at newcomers who may not know anything about how your product works, and should hold their hand through their first experience with your product. A tutorial should get a learner started, not make them an expert.

Having completed a tutorial, the learner should be in a position to start to make sense of:
- the rest of the documentation
- the product itself

Learning takes place through what the pupil DOES. Facts and explanations are almost irrelevant at this stage. What matters is what you can get the learner to DO.

A tutorial for beginners is not the same as “best practice.” It’s OK to have new learners do things differently from an advanced user. The learner should enjoy the experience, see immediate success from their actions, and gain confidence and a sense of achievement.


PROPOSAL:

A beginner tutorial will walk a learner through creating a fully-functioning blog site, starting from the minimal template. The completed project will include:

- 3 Astro static pages: Home, About, Blog
- 3 Markdown blog posts
- 2 layouts: BaseLayout and MarkdownLayout
- 1 Astro dynamic page [tags].astro that also generates a page for each blog post tag in use
- 2 - 4 Astro components (Header, Footer, a reusable component for multiple pages…)
-  a global style sheet at src/styles/global.css
- 1 UI framework Integration (TBD - Solid? Choose your own adventure path?)
- 1 styling Integration (Tailwind?)
- 1 Astro integration (Astro Icons?)
