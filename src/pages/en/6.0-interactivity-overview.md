## Goals

BY THE END OF THIS SECTION, YOU WILL HAVE:

- used client-side JavaScript to create a color theme toggle

- fetched data from an external API (at build time) using Astro's top-level await

- used the `astro-add` command to add an official Astro integration

- created an interactive UI framework (Preact) component

Now that you have a fully-featured blog, let's add some interactivity to extend your site!

## Summary

All the content on your site is **static**. A reader can navigate your site through links, but othwerwise, there is nothing for them to interact with.

We have used some build-time JavaScript to create and render parts of your site dynamically, but we do not yet have any client-side JavaScript, nor UI framework components (e.g. React, Svelte, Vue), that allow your readers to trigger any changes to the site.

Let's do that now!

## Before You Go
