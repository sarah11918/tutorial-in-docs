GETTING STARTED TEST

In this tutorial, you will build a full-functioning Astro blog website, step-by-step, taking you from zero to full launch! :rocket:

Along the way, you'll see Astro core concepts like partial hydration, component-based composition and file routing in action, and you wiil also learn:
- how to set up your development environnment and start a new project
- how to create and edit pages for your website
- how to build with Astro components
- how to customize your site with Astro integrations

If you would rather start by playing with a pre-built Astro site in your browser, you can visit https://astro.new and choose a starter template to open in a functioning code/preview environment in an online editor.

You can also visit https://astro.build/play to see how Astro component-based composition works in a single page.

This tutorial is designed to accommmodate people with differing level of web development experience. Feel free to skip ahead to [whatever start section] if you are ready to jump right into the code.

-------
The "My Learning Astro Blog" that you will build has many of the features you would expect in a developer blog: an About page, a Contact page, and a Blog Index page linking to individual blog posts. The finished blog will be ready to deploy to the web, and can even be used as a personal website once you have completed this tutorial!

After completing the tutorial, your finished blog will look like this: [link to finished blog], [screenshots]

Checklist for moving on:
