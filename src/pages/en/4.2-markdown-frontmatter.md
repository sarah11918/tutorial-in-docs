## BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:
- added additional metadata to a blog post
- used YAML frontmatter as variables when writing Markdown
- passed frontmatter values as props to an Astro layout component


Now that you have your first `.md.` blog post written, let's see how Astro can supercharge your standard Markdown!

## Add extra frontmatter properties

1. Add two new YAML frontmatter properties to `src/pages/posts/post-1.md`:
```diff
---
title: 'My First Blog Post'
pubDate: '2022-07-01'
description: 'This is the first post of my new Astro blog.'
+ author: 'Astro Learner'
+ pubDate: 2022-07-01
+ postImage: 'https://astro.build/assets/blog/astro-1-release-update/cover.jpeg' 
---
```

2. Update the Markdown content in `post-1.md` to use some of your properties defined in frontmatter.

```diff
+ _{frontmatter.description}_

- # My First Blog Post
+ {frontmatter.title}
+ Written by: {frontmatter.author}

Welcome to my new blog about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Installing Astro

First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

## Making Pages

I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

## Making Blog Posts

This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!
```

3. Check your browser preview at `localhost:3000/posts/post-1` and verify that:
 - the page `description` in frontmatter is now at the top of your page, in italic font
 - your page's title remains unchanged, even though the code has been refactored!
 - you also have an image displayed on your page


## Pass frontmatter properties to a layout

Your frontmatter values can be used not only within your Markdown, but are also available to an Astro layout specified with the special `layout` frontmatter property.
1. Create a new file at `src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro`
2. Copy the following code into `MarkdownPostLayout.astro`

```astro
---
const { content } = Astro.props
---
<p>{content.title}</p>
<slot />
<p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
```
2. Add the following frontmatter property in `post-1.md`
```diff
---
+ layout: ../../layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro
title: 'My First Blog Post'
pubDate: '2022-07-01'
description: 'This is the first post of my new Astro blog.'
author: 'Astro Learner'
postImage: 'https://astro.build/assets/blog/astro-1-release-update/cover.jpeg' 
---
```

3. Check your browser preview again at `localhost:3000/posts/post-1` (or by adding `/posts/post-1` to the end of the current preview URL in your browser). You should notice two differences to your page, added by your layout:
- The date at the very top of your page
- A link to go back to your home page at the very bottom of your page 



## Test your knowledge:

Fill in the blanks with **Markdown (`.md`)**, **`src/pages/**, **HTML tags**, and **no content**:

I can put files in the ________________ directory, and in its sub-folders, to create pages on my website. Astro regognizes and builds a page for my site if a file exists here, even if it has ____________ to display. 

To create content for pages built with `.astro` files, I include standard HTML elements. But, when I create pages using ________________ files, I can write using a simplified syntax that does not require _____________ .   


## Checklist for moving on:
[ ] I have created a new folder for my blog posts
[ ] I have created my first Markdown (`.md`) blog post in this new folder
[ ] I understand that Markdown is another language that, like Astro, produces HTML in my browser.
[ ] I can read more about Markdown on my own if I need to!
