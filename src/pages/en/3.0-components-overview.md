## BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:
- created reusable Astro components for UI items on your website (e.g. Header, Footer)
- used standard HTML elements alongside Astro components in the same component template
- passed data from one Astro component to another using `props` passed as a component attribute
- passed data from one Astro component to another using a `<slot />`
- created a layout template that can be used to render multiple pages


Now that you have multiple `.astro` files generating pages on your website, let's explore component-based design in Astro to make and reuse smaller bits of HTML!

## Summary
The building blocks of an Astro site are **components**. Astro components are `.astro` files that generate HTML. An Astro component can generate the HTML for an entire web page, like our existing `index.astro`, `about.astro`, and `blog.astro`. Or, they can produce smaller units of HTML that can be included on your page.
