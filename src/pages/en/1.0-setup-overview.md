## BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:
- created a new Astro project and be ready to code in an editor
- created a repository in an online code hosting platform, and connected it to a web host
- published a live, Astro site on the web!

Now that you have the required tools and accounts to begin building an Astro website, let's put all the pieces together!

## Summary
After completing these steps, you will have created a new project that is **stored online in GitHub** and **connected to Netlify**. 

Netlify will use the files in your GitHub repository to build your website, and then publish it on the internet at a unique address where anyone can view it! Netlify will continuously monitor your GitHub repository for any committed changes, and will rebuild and republish your site to reflect those changes.
