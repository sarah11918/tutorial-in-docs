## Goals

BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:

- 

- 

- 

## Add a UI Framework Component

1. Quit the dev server to have access to the terminal control C
```bash
npx astro add preact
```

2. Follow instructions to confirm Y 2 times -- once to add to astro config array of integrations; once to install the package

3. new component `src/components/Quote.jsx`


## React Quote Generator

This component is interactive, written using React. You might already have a component like this in an existing React App. But that's OK, just plop it right into Astro! Use all your fave React Hooks like `useState()` and `useEffect()`.

Note: This will access `document`, so needs to be `client:load`

```jsx

import { React, useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function Quotable() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  async function updateQuote() {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.quotable.io/random");
      const data = await response.json();
      setData(data);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    updateQuote();
  }, []);

  if (!data) return null;

  return (
    <div>
      <blockquote >
        <p>{data.content}</p>
        <p> -- {data.author}</p>
      </blockquote>
      <button onClick={updateQuote}>New Quote</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Preact Banner

Showing this component, like many of our Astro components, *uses* JavaScript to render HTML. But, it isn't meant to be **interactive**, so it doesn't **need** any JavaScript sent to the client to work in response to user interactions. So, WE don't need to give it any client directive!

```jsx
import { h } from 'preact'

export default function Banner({messages}) {
    
    const greeting = messages[(Math.floor(Math.random() * 4))]
    
    return (
        <h3>{greeting}! Thank you for visiting!</h3>
    )
}
```

BUT, we CAN make this client:load and have the message update on every page refresh. Otherwise, we are just getting a random greeting at BUILD time.

## Updated Index Page

```astro
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
import Quote from '../components/Quote.jsx';
import Banner from '../components/Banner.jsx';
---
<BaseLayout title="Home Page">
	<h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
	<Banner messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hola"]}/>
	<Quote client:only="react" />
  <Banner client: load messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hola"]}/>
</BaseLayout>

```
